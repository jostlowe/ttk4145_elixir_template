## Disclaimer
I take no responsibility for your use of this code. Use at your own account, be smart and make good choices

## Running the code
You need two things to get this running:
- *A unique cookie*: An identifier that only you use. This prevents your elevators from getting tangled with other peoples elevators.
- *A node name*: This must be on the format `identifier@ipaddress`. The identifier can be virtually anything, but the ip address must be the ip of the host computer

Example command:
```
iex --cookie safarikjeks --name elevator@127.0.0.1 -S mix 
```
